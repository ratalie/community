## Project Description
<!--Describe your project in a few sentences. -->
A multi-chain interface explorer, to make NFTs available to people with disabilities. Setup a multi-chain interface explorer, if marketplaces, sites or apps do not have it implemented. A reusable component to read those additional attributes from all the chains, it is agnostic as far as the standard field to read is defined on each chain’s explorer interface (tested with ton.sh #API explorer, etherscan, algoexplorer, polysgoncan and harmony explorer)
Setup a standard that all blockchains can use with a tag and the description on a field that is mainly unused. <img src="https://github.com/ratalie/TransparentNFTs/blob/master/images/screen1.png">

 Once the standard is well known, people receive incentive to complete the description for the NFTs <br>
… yes that’s tokens for that bounty—this should need graceful sponsors committed to diversity to fund!<br>
<b>Problem</b><br>
Currently, the NFT market is been focused on the creation and trading of graphic (static or animated, sound based) art.<br>

That leaves behind a great number of people with disabilities that cannot get the information of what the pieces of art are about, thus, cannot complete their research to be part of this ecosystem.<br>

Other people supporting them can be helpful, but we should consider a standard to include on the information inherent to the NFT<br>

## Use of IPFS, Filecoin and Libp2p
<!-- Describe how your project uses any or all of these technologies, and why. -->
We are connecting IPFS with Miralis to store our multichain front end and additional data off-chain if needed

## Project Status
